creating the test that xiaoqiang created





Keys: {ab} {cde} {fg}
Response: {bcx} {de} {fg}

         key coref links: C_k = {(ab), (cd), (de), (ce), (fg)}} 
     key non-coref links: N_k = {(ac), (ad), (ae), (bc), (bd), (be), (af), (ag), (bf), (bg), (cf), (cg), (df), (dg), (ef), (eg)}

    response coref links: C_r = {(bc), (bx), (cx), (de), (fg)}
response non-coref links: N_r = {(bd), (be), (cd), (ce), (xd), (xe), (bf), (bg), (cf), (cg), (xf), (xg), (df), (dg), (ef), (eg)}

(I'll use ^ for set intersection)
C_k ^ C_r = {(de), (fg)} => R_c = |C_k^C_r| / |C_k| = 2/5, P_c = 2/|C_r| = 2/5, F_c = 2/5 = 0.40
N_k ^ N_r = {(bd), (be), (bf), (bg), (cf), (cg), (df), (dg), (ef), (eg)} => R_n = |N_k^N_r|/|N_k| = 10/16,  P_n = 10/|N_r| = 10/16, F_n = 10/16 = 0.625

BLANC = 1/2 (F_c + F_n) = 0.5125
