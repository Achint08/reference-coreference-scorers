VERSION
-------

The current stable version is v8.01

Usage
-----


  ::
     perl scorer.pl <metric> <key> <response> [<document-id>]


     <metric>: the metric desired to score the results. one of the following values:

     muc: MUCScorer (Vilain et al, 1995)
     bcub: B-Cubed (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998)
     ceafm: CEAF (Luo et al., 2005) using mention-based similarity
     ceafe: CEAF (Luo et al., 2005) using entity-based similarity
     blanc: BLANC (Luo et al., 2014) BLANC metric for gold and predicted mentions
     all: uses all the metrics to score

     <key>: file with expected coreference chains in CoNLL-2011/2012 format

     <response>: file with output of coreference system (CoNLL-2011/2012 format)
 
     <document-id>: optional. The name of the document to score. If name is not
                    given, all the documents in the dataset will be scored. If given
                    name is "none" then all the documents are scored but only total
                    results are shown.


OUTPUT
------

The score subroutine returns an array with four values in this order:

Coreference Score
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recall = recall_numerator / recall_denominator
Precision = precision_numerator / precision_denominator
F1 = 2 * Recall * Precision / (Recall + Precision)

Also recall, precision and F1 are printed in the standard output when variable ``$VERBOSE`` is not null.


Identification of mentions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A score for identification of mentions (recall, precision and F1) is
also included.  Mentions from system response are compared with key
mentions. This version performs strict mention matching as was used in
the CoNLL-2011 and 2012 shared tasks.
