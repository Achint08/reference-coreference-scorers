creating the test that xiaoqiang created





Keys: {ab} {cde}
Response: {bcx} {de}

key coref links:  C_k = {(ab), (cd), (de), (ce)}
key non-coref links: N_k = {(ac), (ad), (ae), (bc), (bd), (be)}

response coref links:  C_r = {(bc), (bx), (cx), (de)}
response non-coref links: N_r = {(bd), (be), (cd), (ce),  (xd), (xe)}

(I'll use ^ for set intersection)
C_k ^ C_r = {(de)} => R_c = |C_k^C_r| / |C_k| = 1/4, P_c = 1/|C_r| = 1/4,
F_c = 1/4
N_k ^ N_r = {(bd), (be)} => R_n = |N_k^N_r|/|N_k| = 2/6,  P_n = 2/|N_r| =
2/6, F_n = 1/3

BLANC = 1/2 (F_c + F_n) = 7/24.

Note that in this example, link (bc) is a key non-coref link and is an
incorrect response coref link.
